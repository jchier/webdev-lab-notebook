## Reflection Document

For the reflection document, I will answer 3 questions for each section:

1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos?

2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section?

3. How well were the topics explained?

### HTML

1. I was able to do most of the exercise by myself, but my knowledge of
   semantics was not great at this point so I referred to the videos after my own
   attempt.

2. The exercises were incredibly helpful for giving me the basic knowledge
   of HTML

3. I felt that the topics were adequately explained. I was still
   somewhat confused about what elements should be used where by the end of it,
   but I did get a solid foundation for completing the first homework assignment.

### Accessibility

1. This section was straightforward enough after the lecture on accessibility. I was
   able to complete it on my own without the video, but still watched the video afterwards
   to double check.

2. This section was very helpful in learning how to run WAVE accessibility checks throughout the term.

3. The topics gone over in the exercise were explained very well. However, the lab portion and the
   video did not go over lighthouse audits. This would have been nice to know, since an error
   found in a lighthouse audit was brought up in my grading.

### CSS

1. The CSS section was my favorite in the whole term. The exercises were fun and not too hard.
   I was able to do most of it myself, and what I couldn't do the videos helped me out with.

2. This section was very helpful for doing homework 2 and throughout the class. As a former
   a graphic design major, I enjoyed playing with layouts and colors.

3. The topics were explained well enough. I would have liked more discussion on how to use
   the developer tools in browser because they are so integral to debugging CSS issues.

### Flexbox

1. After completing the previous exercise and this week's lecture, I was able to complete most of it by myself.

2. These exercises were very helpful for completing homework 2.

3. The topics were adequately explained to complete the assignment. However, I still found myself
   lost in what type of flex-grid configuration is the best to use for a given context.

### CSS-Grid

1. I was able to complete most of the assignment without watching the video. But the video did help.

2. Like the flexbox exercise, these were very helpful in completing homework two.

3. The topic was explained pretty well. However, at this point I was getting a little tired of
   of talking about grids and rows of squares on my screen. I felt that using the inspector/dev tools
   was very useful for debugging issues with my grids.

### Bootstrap

1. I found bootstrap pretty confusing, so I relied heavily on the videos

2. The exercises were good to get a hold on bootstrap, although it was a little bit confusing
   to know which bootstrap property to use at any given moment. I really enjoyed the modal exercise

3. The exercises were explained well enough to complete them, although I would have liked more information
   about how to research bootstrap stuff. It would be cool if there was a way to highlight a bootstrap class
   and go right to documentation from the IDE.

### Javascript

1. I was very unconfident about my ability to do any javascript alone, so I resorted to the videos.

2. Watching the videos was very helpful for completing homework 3.

3. I found selecting and creating elements to be straightforward and intuitive,
   however the other functional programming stuff remained over my head. I am still lost
   on how promises work, for example. I feel like the advanced javascript stuff went by too quick.

### Jquery

1. I could not do these exercises without the videos.

2. The videos were helpful for completing the exercices

3. To be honest I found jquery syntax to be very different and complicated. I think the jquery was
   explained as well as it could have been, however being so close to the end of the term
   and after rushing through many advanced javascript topics, my brain had no space left
   to absorb something as different as jquery. I do respect its space in the world of webdev
   and I am happy I was at least introduced to the topic.

### Closing thoughts:

Most of the course was fun and intuitive. As a former graphic design major, I enjoyed
playing with shapes and colors in the CSS portion of the class. The javascript
and jquery portion at the end felt like a serious ramp in difficulty, but I am glad
I got introduced to these topics as they had been very mysterious and scary to me beforehand.
